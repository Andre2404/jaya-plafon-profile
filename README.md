# Project Overview
This project was initially created using **Lovable**, and then further customized to meet my specific needs.

## Architecture
The tech stack includes:
- **Vite**
- **TypeScript**
- **React**
- **shadcn-ui**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **followingdotcursor** (cursor effect using NPM)

## How to Edit and Customize
### 1️⃣ Using Lovable
- Visit the [Lovable Project](https://lovable.dev/projects/f6056f3b-efa8-4ee1-9bea-931a4c2fc873).
- The initial generated code is uploaded to GitHub.
- All changes are automatically committed to this repository.
- I did not edit the code in Lovable but instead moved it to an IDE (Cursor).

### 2️⃣ Using the Cursor IDE with AI Assistant
```sh
# Clone the repository
$ git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
# Navigate to the project directory
$ cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
# Install dependencies
$ npm install
# Run the development server
$ npm run dev
```

### 3️⃣ Adding Cursor Effects
- This project uses the **followingdotcursor** cursor effect.
- Ensure the dependency is installed by running:
```sh
$ npm install followingdotcursor
```

That's all! This is an experiment in creating a profile website enhanced with AI.
